# code_refactor

## Description
This project was created in order to provide practice in making a website more accessible for the user, while also practicing simplification of the starting code for the developers to more easily read in comparison. 

## Usage
The header for this page features functional links to other sections of the page. Upon inspecting the page with right clicking and selecting inspect, the HTML elements show appropriate semantic tags compared to the original Div tags that were applied to each element. As the webpage was too large to screenshot completely in one image, there are two screenshots for both halves of the [finished page](https://dylan-thrasher.github.io/code_refactor/).
